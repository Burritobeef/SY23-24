    <h3>
        We are a Dixieland jazz band consisting of a trombone, a clarinet, a trumpet, a tuba, a piano, a banjo, drums, and last and very least tenor saxophone. We came together because of the power of our passions in music that we want to share with the world. Help us share our passion for music by renting us for any event.
